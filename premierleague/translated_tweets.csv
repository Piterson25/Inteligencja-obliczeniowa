Youth: Johnson £30m- I may be biased but this Welsh winger has continued his form in Premier League. Still only 22 he has 8 goals in his first top flight season with an inconsistent Forest side. He’s going to make big impressions soon and will likely grow into the next Welsh star https://t.co/hVjPexBXVG,2023-05-30 07:42:20+00:00

"Realistic: Mbeumo £28m - 9 goals and 8 assists is very good output in the Premier League. Still only 23 he has chance to grow. He likes to cut in, similar to Saka; works hard for his team and has end product. Convincing Brentford to sell after the Toney ban may be difficult. https://t.co/rKB2wOoSzZ",2023-05-30 07:42:18+00:00

"The IPL 2023 Finale: A Mirror Reflecting India's Political Chessboard?Dhoni's Farewell Game: A Testament to Democratic Resilience and Regional PrideMay 30, 2023A crisp night, a grand finale, and a compelling narrative unfolded during the 2023 Indian Premier League (#IPL) finals between the Chennai Super Kings (CSK) and the Gujarat Titans. The IPL, a global spectacle known for its thrilling matches and strategic manoeuvres, seemed to echo a tale of regional pride, political undertones, and a battle against the odds.In what was announced as his farewell match, Dhoni's leadership echoed the essence of a true democracy – where the collective, the team, and the people hold supreme power. The Chennai Super Kings stood as a testament to this democratic principle, proving that it is the collective strength of the team that determines the outcome, not the carefully crafted larger-than-life image of a few individuals.In the heart of the game lies the ever-vibrant Tamil Nadu, the cradle of the CSK, a team that carries the pride of its people. A symbolic representation of Southern India's rich heritage, resilience, and their refusal to yield to external forces, whether it was the Mauryans or the Mughals in the historical past. The CSK's showdown with the Gujarat Titans subtly mirrored the political landscape of India, where the Southern states continue to resist the overarching influence of the North.The Titans, a team from Gujarat, appeared to carry an invisible banner of the Gujarat political duo – Prime Minister and Home Minister Amit Shah, along with BCCI President Jay Shah. Video clips are circulating of some strange signals sent out by Jay Shah from the VIP Box in the stadium that the internet seems to have picked and gone viral. The intriguing parallel between the cricketing world and the Indian political scene suggested a Machiavellian plot: a Gujarat Titans victory could be used as a token of national credibility, symbolising the political dominance of the Gujarat duo at the centre.Much like the strategic appropriation of the #Sengol – a symbol of power and valour in Tamil culture – for the new Parliament, there were whispers of the #GujaratTitans being groomed to eclipse the #ChennaiSuperKings. The narrative seemed pre-arranged, the victory board prematurely inscribed with CSK as the runner-up. The target for victory was a massive 215, the highest in an #IPL final. But as rain intervened, reducing the match to 15 overs, the CSK found themselves in an even more uphill battle, with the asking run rate soaring to 11.6 per over at the start of the match. With ten runs required from the last two balls, the odds were stacked against #CSK. Jay Shah, watching from the sidelines, was poised to celebrate the symbolic victory of #Gujarat. But the script was about to be rewritten.Ironically, it was a local Gujarati lad, Ravindra Jadeja, who rewrote the script. The irony was not lost on anyone when Jadeja, whose wife is an elected BJP representative, was the one to score the winning runs in a seemingly lost situation. Baby Shah's gesticulations from the VIP Box, when 12 runs off 4 balls were required, were met with a strong response from the cricket field.Ravindra Jadeja, embodying the spirit of the defiant #TamilNadu, struck a six and a four, snatching victory from the jaws of defeat. It was a moment that echoed the spirit of the South, standing firm against the might of the North. The unanticipated triumph threw a wrench into the Gujarat duo's plans, highlighting the power of resilience and the unpredictability of the game.The #IPL2023 #finale was a testament to the unyielding spirit of the South, a region that continues to assert its identity and autonomy in the face of perceived dominance. This thrilling match was a reminder of the power of sport to both mirror and challenge societal and political dynamics. The message was clear: the #South will not be subdued neither on the cricketing field nor the political arena.",2023-05-30 05:26:56+00:00

"A couple of questions on how best to approach the final week of the trial to grow your account balance1) if you haven't done this already, sell your Premier League and Bundesliga players - both leagues are finished, players performance points can only depreciate from here, and the demand side will deflate as other trialists sell out of these players.2) Get the best possible squad of players in place for the last dividend gameweek - cutoff time is 6pm Friday. Prioritise La Liga, Serie A and then Ligue One players, as La Liga is the highest weighted league, with Serie A next and Ligue One lowest. I've attached the weighting system rules. Points scored in La Liga are worth x1.5 points scored in Ligue One - meaning to win dividends players in Ligue One need to do more than a La Liga players, but then if you believe Messi or Mbappe will bang in a hattrick that might just do the trick.3) Once 6pm passes on Friday your dividend squad is locked in.  Thereafter we recommend you trade (ie. buy shares) in players playing in as many matches as you can across the weekend. You'll hit some duds, but you'll also hit winners and the trial set-up rewards trading more than inactivity. You can sell out of players post each match and repeat again for the next fixtures. With it being the last weekend, maximise every chance to grow your account balance.4) The last fixtures finish on Sunday night at approx. 10pm - once players unfreeze, the best strategy for the trial is to sellout of your portfolio as quickly as possible. This will deliver a double win for your account balance, maximising the sale price of your shareholdings, and thereafter driving down the value of your trial competitors shareholdings in the same players - as part of our secret sauce share-price formula is driven by demand, every share bought drives the share-price up and every share sold drives it down.The final leaderboard will whatever the value of all trialists account balances are at midnight on Sunday night.We will send final prizes and summary on Monday.Best of luck and thanks to everyone for supporting the trial of what we believe will be a transformational product when we fully launch.",2023-05-29 21:37:00+00:00

"People saying that he wouldn't do well in the Premier League is funny, because what he was going to do with goals and assists in this horrible league in defensive matters is a joke.",2023-05-29 21:12:20+00:00

"@YChhdfj @Fabio_hSousaa @futebol_info Injured in December? Since he would even miss a league round, possibly the Premier League. Like I said, there's always going to be clowns applauding, and that's it.

"The Premier 22-23 is already history. And that is why each day that passes, a goal of the season is raised, until a new one begins in August. 1. Taiwo Awoniyi v Arsenal.

A Fabio loan deal to another premier league or a Bundesliga team would make the most sense. Even if he went to Portugal where he’s fluent in the language it would help his career. I just feel that selling him could bite us in the arse big time,2023-05-29 21:10:58+00:00

"Messi would get the contract in Arabia in two years without any problems. He would still be 37 to 38 years old. It would be too stupid to go there now. If Barcelona can't register, the best decision is to go to the Premier League, even if you have to reduce the salary",2023-05-29 21:10:37+00:00
Can you imagine seeing Leo in the premier league,2023-05-29 21:10:31+00:00
It's inevitable he's going to leave but I'd genuinely take 20% less on the transfer fee if it was Bayern over a Premier League club. Rice's family is so important to him though so I can see him staying in the UK/London.,2023-05-29 21:10:28+00:00

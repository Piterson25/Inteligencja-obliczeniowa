@ChelseaFC should seriously consider going for Julian Alvarez in the Summer Transfer Window. This player is world class and already established in the Premier League. @TheBlueDodger @TheChelseaForum @CFCPys @siphillipssport
It would also mean we get to press high, which would automatically mean we’d score 60 more goals than we did already this season in the premier league alone
"Recency bias" is really ridiculous in English media.
1-2 months of poor results and everyone thinks Arsenal's season as 'poor'.At start of season,no one bet on them finishing even in top 6.
Now, since the team couldn't win title, they are labelled 'underachiever'

@DebsHLUFC @BarneyLUFC21 Absolutely agree. Good footballers should be able to adapt, even if the tactics aren't the best. And agree, Marsch ball was just chaotic nonsense. Fine in the Austrian Sunday league where it was successful, but premier league far too strong for that to work.

Tak, to samo śledztwo, które mają nadzieję zakończyć.

Premier League była tak sfrustrowana taktyką opóźniania City, że dwa lata temu zwróciła się do Sądu Apelacyjnego, oskarżając klub o „złożenie jak największej liczby wniosków proceduralnych i skarg, aby spowolnić dzień -&gt;
Historia dotyczyła podjęcia przez City działań prawnych w celu zakwestionowania sposobu, w jaki Premier League może badać swoje finanse. To to samo miasto, które kwestionuje każdy ze 115 zarzutów. Najlepszym sposobem na to byłoby zaoferowanie otwartego dostępu do ich kont -&gt;

He'd fit the progressive 8 role alongside Casemiro very well. As I said, sceptical at the price tag but he's premier league ready.

It seems to boil down to this: bullying other clubs to accept first the Premier League &amp; then the CL, both designed to ensure more money for the ‘big’ clubs &amp; cement their continued dominance 
= fair play.

Arsenal harus menerima kenyataan. Sebab, mereka menguasai puncak klasemen Premier League 2022/2023 selama 248 hari. Namun karena performa The Gunners menurun malah membuat Man City menjadi juara.

When we finished 9th it wasn’t because we had a great Premier League squad, it was because we had an incredible footballing brain at the top. When we go down, we could potentially build a better squad than the one we came up with, but the manager/DOF/retainee’s will be key. #LUFC

Either help him or just walk on and put your phone away. 

Just because you play for Chelsea, it does not give you the right to mock people; 

At the end of the day you both have the same amount of Premier League goals and you’ve played in 14 games more …

@COYIronscom He got us  back into the Premier league at the first attempt, and kept us there. He deserves our thanks for that.
But the style of football was dire to watch and I doubt that we would have filled the london stadium.

@Saints_Mike7167 @SaintRob__ @s4intkingy1999 So by your way of thinking then JWP, KWP, Lavia and Che are are not good enough for mid table premier league teams then because they didn’t achieve that this season and were relegated? So Le Tiss wasn’t good enough to play for a top side if he chose to leave
@HLTCO Without doubt our best signing of this Premier League era.
I hope he returns to the club as a coach one day.

It’s insane to me that the president of La Liga is a member &amp; supporter of a fascist party and no one bats an eye. Imagine if the Premier League’s CEO or chairman was a member of the National Front.
I'd be lying to say I'm watching Premier League matches after we Won the PL. Just waiting for the 2 matches in early June.

Betfair makes Man City 8/15 to win the PL title next year and #NUFC second favourite at 15/2. Much as I love NUFC and much as I think we have a good chance of finishing top 4 again next season, I think 15/2 for the title are overly short odds. What do you think? #PremierLeague

@Saints_Mike7167 @s4intkingy1999 My case makes sense Mike. Buying good players from bad teams makes sense economically as they will be cheaper, are experienced in the league and are capable of playing at a much higher standard.

@MirrorFootball If another premier league side took a punt on him and played him consistently on the right of a front 3 i think you'd see a much better player. Not been given that chance at man utd imho. Played him on left as well sparingly. Less pressure would help him.

Ilkay Gundogan reveals what made #MCFC Premier League triumph 'different' to previous seasons
https://t.co/5P9liLbFRK
Premier League football clubs spent more on agent's fees for men last season than they've spent on the women's game since the WSL began in 2011! 
This is outrageous. 
We have to make budgets in sport fair for women and girls.

@ukworkin @danielgoyal Every single one was getting paid more in real terms for the same level of training and skill.

Has a Premier league manager role salary been cut by 26% in real terms since 2008?

Has your current role seen a paycut of 26% compared to 2008 levels? Genuinely interested to know.

When Warnock signed him for £8m, my first impression was "what a waste of money"...how wrong I was.

Has definitely been one of the most underrated players in the Premier League over the last 9 years, before injuries caught up with him. Hoping he gets a start on Sunday. #cpfc
😭 McArthur said: “If you’d have told me when I first came to Crystal Palace that I’d be here for nine seasons, I’d have found it hard to believe, because it’s rare in football to spend so long at such an amazing Premier League club.

“I would like to thank everyone: all my managers, the Chairman, [Sporting Director] Dougie Freedman, and the players present and past. I’ve had a journey with so many people here over the years.

“I also want to say a massive thank you to every one of the fans. The support that I’ve had personally, and the support that they give the team, is like at no other club. When times are tough, Palace fans really get behind the team, and that’s so important to all of us. I will always be a fan of the club.”

Steve Parish said: “James has been a mainstay of the side for the best part of a decade, and has never given less than 100% when pulling on the shirt – his tenacity and energy has unquestionably had a huge impact on us retaining our Premier League status for that record period of time.
“An absolute stand-out professional, on and off the pitch, James’ leadership and character will be hard to replace. I’d like to personally thank him for his contribution to the club; and wish him and his family nothing but the very best for the future. We look forward to one day welcoming him back; he will always be welcome at Selhurst Park.”

But case in point you're viewing simply being in the Premier League and finishing top of the 2nd tier as success.

Which makes sense as you've never seen your club win anything real
@enda_coll @DavidSneyd Are those who feel disenfranchised fans who remember pre-Premier League times ? (I don’t feel disenfranchised- just less in love with it). Because there must be a great many fans for whom the Premier League and all its greed, commercialism and bombast is all they’ve ever known

@JenoLUFC @talkSPORT I’m glad you know whats happening, I’ll let the premier league know that’s there’s know that there is no need to carry out there investigation 👍🏻 in the mean time sit back and watch us enjoy the premiership next year whilst you play Rotherham in the championship 😂😂

6 commentaries in total via the talkSPORT app.
For Sky and British football, he was the player others loved to hate, but were compelled to watch, because they knew he would do something they had to see. No other player in Premier League history captivated in quite the same way. It was convenient for all parties, inc. Eric.
@kjohno10 @WestHamViews_ @MailSport He’s scored twice the amount (12 goals)  as last season in a terrible Leicester side in the league. I think that’s impressive, and his play style massively compliments ours. Proven premier league player and still relatively young.
@malose_ranoto @PaballoMaz90937 @eugenekhoza Mashele can come out and tell the true as you view it. Then what?
Los jugadores de la Premier League hincan rodilla para satisfacción del nuevo Ku Klux Klan, BLM, sopena de ser sancionados. De eso va toda esta mierda.

That was the story of the start of the first Premier League campaign. Goals were hard to come by. Efforts to sign Shearer and Hirst were unsuccessful. A chance phone call from Leeds enquiring about Irwin led to a rebuttal and a reverse query - would you let Cantona go?

How nice it is to watch the build up to the Championship playoff final already knowing what division we're in next season. Hopefully we can use the extra preparation time that we didn't have last year wisely. #NFFC

What actor would you have play the manager?
Pep Guardiola: "I will stay at Man City next season. I’m not thinking of leaving the club”. 🚨🔵 #MCFC

“I’ll stay next season with 100 breaches for the Premier League against us, don’t worry. We will be there”.
José Mourinho's Man United in the Premier League

• 81 points
• 28 goals conceded
• 18 clean sheets
• Won against all of the other 19 Premier League clubs
• +40 GD

They called him the problem when he was the one that knew the solution.
Now people are saying Vinicius Jr must point out racism at the Bernabéu. Come on, a kid is complaining about racist abuse he has received and people want him to be the Nelson Mandela of racism in Spain? Really, racism is everywhere. Even in the premier league. Lol what a joke!

@realmixing_desk @Altgthr @martynziegler It’s up to the premier league to provide the evidence. If you got arrested for murder would you provide evidence of your guilt. Let them take you to court and then show the evidence of your innocence
PREMIER LEAGUE!

BRIGHTON - MANCHESTER CITY 

Fresh from lifting their third successive Premier League title, champions Manchester City travels to the Amex Stadium to face Brighton in the penultimate game of the top-flight campaign.

Enjoy the game! https://t.co/VIdSjZZKw5 https://t.co/6j1F6yxV8R
@COYSJordan94 @WorldofHotspur British passport gets you a lot in the premier League. There's a lot of mediocrity coming through the ranks of top clubs.
@parmerafiufiu @goleada_info N sei se substituiria o veiga pq são estilos de jogo diferente, mas esse cara deita e rola lá no camp russo, pra não falar que ele só joga bem lá ele enfrentou times de Premier league em outros campeonatos e teve o msm desempenho, acho que não vem pelo preço n por ser bagre
Got given a guard of honour in a supermarket this morning, sadly I’ve not won the premier league though
@DavidSneyd @enda_coll But I take your point as I’m one of the disenchanted. But more with the overall picture and overwhelming power and bombast of the Premier League.
This is fun. Myth-busting this season's Premier League storylines with @oilysailor.

@TobyNCFC I don’t know about you, but in a situation where staying up is within your hands, you would want to go out and win. Or at least give it a go.

Leicester won the premier league in recent years, and this current squad the FA cup.

They are no minnows.. they looked appalling

So Salah has only won one premier league title and every other club trophy but you are asking if his legacy will be under threat. I feel like the fact that you ask such a question is like a backhanded complement to Salah. You know the answer but you don’t want to admit it.

Arsenal will win a premier league title in the next 3 years and I am hoping a champions league title. You can see that’s the clubs goal
So according to reports Pep said he'd still stay at The Cheats when their found guilty. First of all I don't believe him because they could be relegated out of the Premier league. And secondly even if he dies its says everything about him
@Tapadibal_ Ligue 1 - Premier league ?? Y’a peut être un soucis mdr
Yeaahhh, Ted is definitely going back to America for his kid. Nate is definitely going to replace him. AFC Richmond is definitely winning the Premier League title.

@NoSaudiToon @premierleague @PIF_en @SkySports_Keith This is not new info. I don't think the Premier League have ever said or pretended that PIF is not part of the Saudi state. The statement confirmed that the KSA would not "control" the club. By that I interpret that MBS is not making the decisions

@sincerelyadamo He's a business man, all the things he did was to make money. We missed our first season back in the Premier league due to covid, after that there was no investment in players. He tried to keep us up with championship players until he could sell for maximum profit.
@talkSPORT Never ceases to amaze me…If  someone has the funds required and they want to buy a bank…they can buy a bank, or a Newsagents or a Resteraunt chain. A Premier League club is a business,if someone has the money to buy one they buy one! Unless Scott Minto decides he doesnt like it
@talkSPORT Morally, he’s probably right but the premier league whored itself to the highest bidder. An international league played in England. What gets me is people reacting like it’s a shock. City were an average top flight side, now they have spent a billion on players.

@talkSPORT @NoelGallagher The Premier League had one objective from inception; make a ton of cash. They didn’t care about markets in the far east or footballs made by small children in Pakistan. That happened when someone else protested later. Fair Play is/was alien to PL. In 20yr, 1 team won it 13 times.

चेन्नई सुपरकिंग्स (Chennai Super Kings) ने इंडियन प्रीमियर लीग ( Indian Premier League) के पहले क्वालीफायर मुकाबले में मंगलवार को यहां गत चैम्पियन गुजरात टाइटंस को 15 रन से शिकस्त देकर 10वीं बार फाइनल का टिकट कटाया। चेन्नई ने सात विकेट पर 172 रन बनाने के बाद गुजरात टाइटंस को 20 ओवर में 157 रन पर आउट कर दिया।वहीं चेन्नई सुपरकिंग्स के करिश्माई कप्तान महेन्द्र सिंह धोनी क्रीज पर आए तो छक्के की उम्मीद लगाए प्रशंसकों को निराशा हुई। वह एक रन बनाकर आउट हो गए। 18वें ओवर में गुजरात के मोहित शर्मा गेंदबाजी के लिए आए और ओवर की पांचवीं गेंद पर धोनी का विकेट झटका। धोनी ने बड़ा शॉट खेलने के लिए शॉट मारना चाहा लेकिन गेंद सीधा गुजरात टाइटंस के कप्तान हार्दिक पांड्या के हाथों में जा गिरी।

@StatsKMbappe @Hzzz_7 Ils font à mon sens une très bonnes saison l’un comme l’autre. n’oublions pas qu’en ligue 1 en ce moment pour le trophée du meilleur buteur, c’est ultra serré quand même. Mais marquer en Premier League 36 buts c’est un vrai semblable, ce sont eux qui remplacera Messi et Ronaldo.
Selles averages 0.4 points a Premier League game.
Over the course of a 38 game season that's 15 points. 
Joint second worst of any Prem season. 
This is our worst manager and worst team combo.

@lemasaCDLM En serio? Ufff vaya descubrimiento genio, te buscan en la Nasa por saber leer
@Brendon_Ndlovu Mane took the decision immediately after the champions league final,there was no match to be played either at the premier league or at a field,so there's was no way a guard of honor had to be arranged or a farewell party.
@jayrad198900 @TenHagEra he was loaned in league one before and was barely used. ppl need to stop comparing premier league with a league in czech rep. if you know football.
AWB's defensive capabilities are world-class. Losing a player who can lock down any winger put up in front of him, especially to a rival Premier League team would be foolish at best, and insane at worst. https://t.co/eb9kzyiHez

Arsenal who were 1st for over 250 days, lead by 8 points, will still not be Premier League Champions…😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣

@Red_Scouser1892 @JotaBelieveIt They already did make noise. Last season and this season. The clubs who made complaints were named. But it seems Leicester are on just as shaky ground. The premier league were handed evertons books and have been overseeing spending since before the allegations.

Saka has been directly involved in 56 goals in the Premier League (30G, 26A), which is the exact same figure as Cesc Fàbregas when the Spaniard was the same age (21 years 260 days). Only four players have been involved in more by that age in Prem history💎https://t.co/oL2oH8acuH

Caralho, esses 12,90 são muito surreais. kkkk

@oblivious2munch @nocontextfooty If it's more entertaining than Premier League why don't the teams get 80 million from tv every year in Italy? Serie A is a disaster and it will only get worse. Even Italians like Frattesi dream of Premier League, Juve can be a first step up for him.

Counting majors in FedEx or Race to Dubai is like counting Champions League wins towards the standings in the Premier League. Should be:
100 pts for elevated event
50 pts for non-elevated
Top 75 make Tour Championship to compete for 30 guaranteed spots in majors. @ColtKnost

@bluwes @Altgthr @martynziegler The legal system also carries severe sanctions for parties who obfuscate and deliberately obstruct an investigation — something for which City have become synonymous — and among the primary reasons why the Premier League has taken so long in its inquiries to lay 115 charges.

If these charges are true, corruption of this scale should count.

Por isso o United não alcança o City nunca mais… Neymar não é jogador pra Premier League e pra time que foca no coletivo.
@Rocket_Sauce13 @AdamCrafton_ That’s all it is. The Premier league thought they could extort some fines out of City, and the city wouldn’t fight them.

They were wrong. Now they are in the process of submitting.

Ya estando más tranquilo uno puede sacar conclusiones del partido de hoy en Brasil. Los goles anulados por var, uno de ellos bien anulado, pero el primero es de esas jugadas típicas de la premier League donde ponen línea verde a favor del equipo que anota, pero en la Conmebol..

Tibu a mi ya me harto la liga española, es un auténtico show de televisión barato, el VAR, Los árbitros, El que te lo quieren vender como "la mejor liga del mundo" cuando todos sabemos que no le llegan ni a los tobillos a la Premier League, y el tema de @vinijr es un tema PERSONAL con la persona, ha pasado 5 años de su carrera en España y ningún aficionado rival lo respeta, nadie lo quiere, y la única manera de combatir ese odio es elevandote por encima de ese odio como?

Demostrando que eres un mejor jugador qué Ronaldinho en su momento o mejor extremo qué Mbappé en el presente porque asi es como nos lo han querido vender y eso esta BIEN CABRÓN qué lo pueda conseguir

@2000MetaV @danishsahibole @AlekiCalling @hameobi @SkySportsPL Chelsea were in the quarter finals this season…. Arsenal will be fine as they will add to the squad. The premier league is overall far stronger than the others and a useless Chelsea this season hitting the quarterfinals proves just that.

Even if a court threatened the clubs, they could simply walk through matches against City and let them win 38 games in a row by whatever score they wanted. The rest could fight it out for the real title

@CFCMod_ To be honest, with how far ahead city are of us and every one else, if we're being realistic it's definitely going to hit atleast 10 years before we win a premier league trophy again.

Literally nothing at Chelsea right now tells me we can even get close in the next 2 or 3 years.

@worldsoccertalk @kkfla737 you talked about the ingredients that make the Premier League so big. You had 4. I think there are 2 more - history and supporters.  There is an immediate story for every club. And support makes the product feel like you need to feel what they feel.
@UTDTrey He’s literally better than the whole Man Utd team! So what you mean tho! He should receive less so y’all can laugh too! Nahhh nicca we pay the players right now! It’s 2023! &amp; we are a top club TOP 2 in the English Premier League!! Put some respeck on our players yo! @UTDTrey
El equipo del régimen lo hizo una vez más.  Fulminaron árbitros y además retiran expulsiones por agresiones, como el planeta fútbol sabe: Florentino Pérez maneja todo.

Corinthians tem 11% dos direitos econômicos de Robert Renan e ainda pode lucrar com o defensor.

O zagueiro que possui sondagens de times da Premier League, deixou o Corinthians em troca pela permanência definitiva de Yuri Alberto no início do ano. 

Em meio a negociações dos direitos do jogador, o estafe de Robert Renan cedeu os 25% que tinha direito ao Zenit em troca de vantagens em seu contrato, já o Novorizontino trocou seus 20% por 9%, portanto o Timão ficou com 11% do atleta.

Difference between Egypt Premier League and Botola Pro 🇪🇬🇲🇦

 - Last season, Al Ahly was 3rd in the league, but the Egyptian association entered Al Ahly for the Champions League because they were in the top 2 after a certain round 

- This season, Al Ahly will quietly finish the remaining games without a fair course of the competition

- In Botola Pro, on the other hand, the matches are made up almost immediately and the final phase of the competition is played on the same day
Who will finish higher in the Premier League next season: Chelsea or Manchester United?

@LoyisoGalada @ajajah1960 @TheRealPitso We’re absolutely grateful for pitso and his team for the promotion but he wouldn’t keep up in the Saudi premier league the teams are very strong we need a better staff to lead the club we are talking about the future and again and again big thanks for the south african team 🇿🇦
@Marcus135125127 @Kamande48 @AndersonMJames @FPLKSI @SkySportsPL @Carra23 @GNev2 Yeah so stop making like Kane outscored Haaland this season, he's way better than Kane, you people try to overshadow Haaland's season by saying he's playing with Kdb etc, Kane never reached this levels of Haaland and has been in the Premier league his entire life.
Um cara me disse que um jogador da base do Flu recusou proposta de 20 milhões de euros da Premier League pois quer "ficar com a família". Lembram da proposta de 40 milhões de euros do Newcastle pelo Andrey, que acabou virando 12 milhões no Chelsea?Galera é muito inocente,meu Deus
@bigalkaline_ @Txiki_BlueBible @City_Xtra @cfbayern Opinions like these should only stick to your mind, don't talk them you don't know football you know premier league only I respect that
@augustoferron_ Bom, tanto houve, quanto que se você abrir e pesquisar, vários ingleses imploram pela investida do time no André. 

E bom, o André não está na Premier League pelo simples fato que proposta foi recusada. Se tivesse, provavelmente estaria muito bem, assim como o Danilo e o Douglas.
@PSGINT_ @armin_ejupovic @Neycromancer neymar was lucky he didn't play in the premier league when he was 18. he would have been injured 6 months in every season because of how hard the premier league was.
@AndiOnrubia @lequipe Mbappé vs Haaland en la Premier League 🤔
On 6 August 2022, in Fulham's first match of the 2022–23 Premier League season, Mitrović scored both goals in a 2–2 home draw against Liverpool. On the way, we were saying we would take a 4 - 0 loss lmao.

@fred_designs10 @pkxthfc @thfcsxn @AlexScott_7 @England So he’d reject the club he loves. In the premier league. To try get a team in Bristol promoted? Get a grip of yourself
@jonnyhawke He’d show his quality in any team, in any league. It’s just a shame we never got to see him in the Premier League.

I blame Manchester United lots pal, but it's not only Manchester United that behave like the premier league has four winners is it?  Every cunts at it now.   City are winning the league every season because everyone else is under no pressure to improve.  

Hope this helps

@okjpaguiar Bom, o João Gomes e o Danilo estão na Premier League também, são melhores que o André entao?
@SkySportsNews In serie A  a big club like Juventus can be charged with point deductions,so why not Man city with 130 breaches on their hand. Is the Premier league scared of City.🤔🤔
@ALAHLI_FCEN The team was winning, but with a very bad performance in every match. The Saudi Premier League achieved the historic treble in the past, so the championship of division 1 for us is nothing, so no one celebrates
@MUFC1417 @PeakSanti Pepe scored 16 goals in the premier league. How many has garnacho and Antony scored put together?
@najoua64274145 They've gotten rested before and they still made it to the ucl and fa cup finals and won the Premier league so I have faith in whatever pep decides

“I’ll stay next season with 100 breaches for the Premier League against us.” — also Pep Guardiola.

@TheFergusonWay Another point not choosing Timber is Height. Basically we can have a Lisandro-Varane/Lindelof/KMJ(if deal done then) combo. So, 2 short height player for Premier League is quite tough enough to fight for the team who always play long ball having Ariel ability at peak.

🔹Chelsea's last Premier League win at Old Trafford was in 2013 - Juan Mata was the match winner.

🔹The last 5 games have ended in a draw

🔹Chelsea have the last win between both sides (FA Cup semi final 2020) https://t.co/qEpyjR72wh

@jonnyhawke The Premier League is the hardest league in the world. If you play for Barca, you will have about 6 semi-difficult games all season. Other than games against Real, Atlético, and whoever is in 4th place, it’s basically a season of glorified training sessions.

Has anyone at Man City told Pep the Premier League charges include allegations the club obstructed the investigation, as well as heading to court to question the league’s jurisdiction to investigate it and then once more to prevent any details becoming public?

@UtdXclusive @ncustisTheSun Marital is a mystery. Good player with a bad attitude who rarely delivers. Maybe, like Lukaku, he’s just unsuited to the Premier League. Whatever the truth, his time is surely up.

We would love it tomorrow. This afternoon better than tomorrow. We would love it.

@DentyPaul @CherriesTrust Like others have said Paul, a bit more effort from those on the pitch in last 2 or 3 games would have had us 12th or 13th, due to the size of the club they are only raising a further £300k ish, 1 place in the Premier League, being small makes ticket income irrelevant

@Citizen_baker Great post.  This is exactly what I have said from the start.  The whole point was to drive a negative narrative and tear down the City name.  The rest is just icing on the cake as far as the FA and Premier League teams are concerned.  One could argue this does way more damage.
@MainooFC I'm shocked, too... that he's even playing in the Premier League. He's Championship at best. Certainly, not even in the top left backs.

@jpicksley1995 @Brennan_J20 I don’t want hypotheticals. I want to know if you think Alex Scott is the best player in the champ
@AHLI_HHH @GifDAFC @ALAHLI_FCEN @TheRealPitso Did you buy him players? Or he got a bunch of lost hopes and fuelled confidence in them? Those players where on position 7-8 and had lost hope, you had lost hope too! Nonetheless he did exactly what you hired him to, “Winners back to the Premier League”
@biilvo777 @goal @Arsenal Ok but atleast don't compare premier league with any other leagues in the world

Coutinho is rumoured to leave Aston Villa which is completely understandable.
If he wants to stay in the premier league and get game time I think brighton is the place for him! With 3/4 of their main midfielders potentially leaving this summer and maybe Mitoma, it could be good.

NEW PODCAST: https://t.co/OpD1loRVov Having secured the Premier League title with two games to spare, only United and Inter stand in the way of City  and the treble.
In his other two seasons: 

20/21 season - 22 goals and 5 assists 
19/20 season - 19 goals and 10 assists 

The level of consistency is absolutely crazy, one of the greatest to ever play in Premier League.
@WeekInTheTackle @thomasjrennie all of your rants &amp; before sovereign wealth funds:

“Ferguson appointed manager of Man U in Nov 1986. During his 26 years with Man U he won 38 trophies, including 13 Premier League titles, five FA Cups, and two UEFA Champions League titles.”

But that was fine for you?
Najwyższe xG w tym sezonie Premier League:

@CitySZN__ @WiloDouzinhoo @propsMCFC @David_Ornstein @TheAthleticFC A new winger similiar quality would cost at least 80M and would be on similiar or little less wages. It's also much riskier buying a new player who may or may not adjust to Arsenal and the Premier League. We already need depth in quality.
@jpicksley1995 So why is he being compared to an attacking midfielder? 

He looks like he has a lot of promise, who knows what heights he can reach. To say he’s currently better than a player doing it in the premier league is absurd.

@Pabloki26872508 And you're starved of premier league and champions league trophies.
At the beginning of the season and in the first half of the season, "Bournemouth is definitely down" comments were coming. However, in the Premier League, it remained in the league with a very low staff and young players financially. I think this is really a great achievement. And of course our other candidate; Eddie Howe. See you next season in the Premier League. UTC 🖤🍒

@DK01__ @roadtogIory11 Salah never has and never will reach the levels of Mahrez aesthetically though. So 28 G/A, helping carry Leicester to a Premier League, and being amazing to watch is better than any Salah season.
@JohnDykesFC hosting @premierleague with Andy Townsend as chief pundit. Premier League anthem being "Fire" sang by Kasabian. Actually the beats of the song. 2010-2013. 😊
@HammySamo @rxlfpacked Mahrez has 5 PL titles, one with Leicester, he has three-peat the premier league, he can also potentially win the treble, if he wins UCL, his career is better than mo salahs, though I think prime salah is a better player, mahrez is due course to a better career overall.
@FCDutchie @RikElfrink pak google. Zoek op Premier League International Cup en je krijgt de actuele score, die wordt bijgewerkt indien er iets gebeurt.

The racists who follow Spanish football have been emboldened by years of inaction by La Liga officials. Often all that will happen if someone unfurls a racist banner is they take away the banner. No one gets banned.

Everton have only scored more than one goal at home once this season…Bournemouth have scored at least one goal in nine of their Premier League away games and netted seven goals in back-to-back home victories over Everton, one of which was in the EFL Cup.
j'ajoute encore que la Premier league est plus dure que la Serie A il a jamais jouer dans ce championnat et donc plusieurs raison qui me font dire que à l'heure actuel c'est pas une tres belle idée mais ça reste un buteur je vais pas mentir sur ça
@jackhowie2 Of course I am, it is the only time i can go to a match. Premier league tickets by Manchester United are expensive!!
@FBAwayDays I want Leeds to stay up, they have played some good football, pleasing to watch, fans are bonkers and always take good away crowds. They are a premier league side!
@WeekInTheTackle @SiriusXMFC @thomasjrennie City have now finished Top 3 in 12 of the last 13 seasons, Top 2 in 8 of the last 10, and won the league 5 of the last 6. And nobody cares. Premier League is becoming Bundesliga 2.0

Four-time champions Chennai Super Kings beat Gujarat Titans by 15 runs in the Qualifier 1 to enter final of the Indian Premier League. Defending champions GT will get another chance to reach the final as they play the winner of the Eliminator in Qualifier 2 at Ahmedabad on Friday. Sent in to bat, opener Ruturaj Gaikwad top-scored with a 44-ball 60 as Chennai Super Kings posted a competitive 172 for seven. In reply, GT were all out for 157 in 20 overs.

@City_Xtra @cfbayern 🤣
@CharlClappo @honeywell053 @ErlingRoIe @swaannv So he was dropped for the others then? I’m not sure what I’m supposed to accept? I think he’s class, just don’t think he’s close to the greats of the premier league
Carragher: “Manchester City don’t want this, Man City supporters don’t want this, the Premier League don’t want this
@d_andradesport Agreed!! 

But in the premier league his missed over 1/4 of the season through suspension - which I think should rule him out. Potentially cost United a title charge, certainly finishing above arsenal! 

Could be the key in FA Cup final though

My favourite recent Forest game is one of the ones where next season’s premier league status was on the line, where we got a fortunate goal in the 1st half, stopped our opponents from shooting, and hung on for 1-0, even though our keeper went off late on. Both those games. #nffc

I think paqueta is amazing and the more he has been with us the better he is becoming. In my opinion he would be a huge success for Milan / Italian league
Not great how the Premier League deals with Financial fair play and La Liga with racism. They need to be careful not to reduce the ‘value of their assets’ to bring the ESL back into the game.

Manchester City win the English Premier League title as Arsenal suffer shock loss https://t.co/VBnmU2hByB
@marshyleeds Brief glimpses of ability but never got to grips with the level of the Premier League. In his defence, he’s been playing in a shit team devoid of any tactical nous or proper coaching. Just hope we get a reasonable amount back for him.
Manchester United Vs Chelsea is the most big six drawn game in premier league history.

Manchester United need a point to qualify for the champions league next season.

You see where I’m going with this….. https://t.co/Amy2On62i3
@XWizardClint @N0TCallumm @thfcsxn we could spend the most money in the summer out of all premier league clubs and still not have the best squad. It’s not about how much you spend in a season. It’s a collective over time. The team he took over was shite, and he’s had them in 2 finals in a row
@callumcasteln Shows how much he's loves it on Trentside. Can't blame him it's a beautiful place. 😍😍

Even in Uganda premier league, I might be a champion, congratulations @SCVillaJogoo
Neville; However, on the other side I must mention that if the Premier League were to not actually see through these charges, the damage to their executives would be equally long-lasting as well.
@radio_bellers @BarneyLUFC21 There’s a photo on here somewhere of the Brighton boardroom after relegation from premier league…the day after. All around table .. planning…. This doesn’t happen again was the attitude. That’s what I wanted next week.

@UnstoppableQana @unsustotellevas @vinijr Não, a solução é regras duras que penalizam não só o torcedor racista, mas o time também. Por que isso não acontece na premier league como acontece na laliga? O problema é a laliga mesmo. Mas deve ser difícil um espanhol entender isso, né?

"Easiest" to coach and set up for most improvement in least amount of time is block defending IMO but it's all hard. Premier league is chock full of top top top coaches posing difficult problems every week.

Would caicedo leave Europa league to play for Chelsea that will play only the premier league next season ???🫣 maybe for more money

@kevoh359 @UtdFaithfuls If City wins the Champions League, Liverpool won't take part in the Champions League even if they finish 5th. Should they (or Inter) win the competition and qualify via the Top 4 in their leagues, it's the Ukrainian Premier League league winners that gain Group Stage passage.

7 league titles in 12 years versus ONE
@JoJz8g He isn’t dominant aerially but also not bad either. I don’t really mind, his other strengths outweigh it
@CFCDani21 @CFCPys @Plettigoal Yeah im on the same wavelength as you. He doesn’t move me, he’s good but he seems like that striker who could go on a goal drought in the premier league. Much more harder defenders his dribbling is a put off. He’s good for a team whose ready made for example Man City &amp; Haaland.
@desertghost32 @Waporte123 @heel_kaybee @City_Xtra Yes and he also brought Bournemouth from the brink of relegation to non-league to the Premier league for 5 straight seasons. Followed by taking Newcastle from 20th to top 4 in 18 months.

@Psych_Squirrel You failed to back Bielsa who guided Leeds back to the Premier League and sacked him to avoid relegation. Bielsa did not just perform, he performed miracles for you and you got rid of him? Man City has money, but money can't buy loyalty. You ungrateful #LUFC fan!

@Yusful4u Much more aggressive in his defending, Colwill is calmer. Gvardiol is a better ball carrier
Very good discussion. Given that approval for the takeover was one for the Premier League, most legitimate route for British govt involvement would have been to press Saudi counterparts to resolve the beIN/piracy issue (takeover was approved 24 hours after its resolution in 2021)
@CuriosidadesPRL A premier league só é o que é, por conta do mercado inflacionado, se não fosse por isso, seria tipo um francesão ou um alemão. É bizarro um time gastar o que gasta mesmo na zona de rebaixamento, não tem nem comparação.
@exarkunaguero @kuzmitchov @JordanTyrell12 @MrProWestie @WelBeast Well, apparently, a time bar is not one of them, which is why the premier league can take action. A time bar doesn't exist in the rules of the premier league, hence their ability to investigate it right now. UEFA had one, so their rulings were made invalid.
@jakub_cfc Chce grać w Premier League. Realnie tę możliwość mogą mu zagwarantować dwa kluby: Chelsea i Manchester United, przy czym United na pewno pójdzie po Kane'a.

Joško Gvardiol’s left foot has laser accuracy &amp; weight of pass. Both under pressure &amp; when breaking down a deep block. He’s also a good ball-carrier. He also helps two ways in a high line with aggression to intercept but also recovery pace. This is a modern-day CB made in a lab. https://t.co/Vm6XRJ2x7C

Erling Haaland will win the Premier League golden boot, but Taiwo Awoniyi’s goals hold more point value 🤔

@GNev2 How the hell are you leaving out Kane who has scored 28 goals for a poor performing Tottenham team who are currently sitting 8th in the Premier League? They’re ain’t many strikers who score that many goals for a mid table team!

@LUFCFANZ0NE If they weren’t up for the fight in the premier league, then they certainly won’t be up for the fight in the championship. 

Even if we stay up, which is highly unlikely, a number of these players should be heading out of the door regardless.

@BlackpoolFC Well, whatever happened before, and you can't blame him to try to gain more experience at a premier league club, let's be honest he's probably the best option after all the other muppets we've had, and at least he's got time to get a good squad together.
Since this game, Liverpool have been to three Champions League finals, winning one, and won the Premier League, FA Cup, League Cup and World Club Championship. How the hell did one game break so many brains for so long.

Erling Haaland will win the Premier League golden boot, but Taiwo Awoniyi’s goals hold more point value 🤔

The context here is this is a sport.  

Sports have pre defined metrics for what success is.  

The premier league has one winner.  

And 19 failures.  

Thats quite literally the sporting context here.  There is no need to bring non sporting metrics into it.  

Hope this helps

I admire the success of teams before 1992 aswell as teams success after the creation of the premier league.

@Karol30965443 @cwiakala I kto z Premier League miałby wyłożyć za niego taką kasę? Chelsea wydaje się być jedyną opcją, ale tam najpierw ma być wyprzedaż i potem ewentualne zakupy+ Chelsea nie będzie grac w Europie, więc wątpię, żeby Kounde chciał tam iść :)

@The_FodenEra Martinelli has more premier league goals than him this season.
During the period between Sir Alex Ferguson's departure and Pep Guardiola's arrival, Premier League  witnessed a time of uncertainty, leading to some exaggeration of average performances. The league has now returned to its customary level of competitiveness and standards.
@PereiraNz @vitinmsf_22 GREALISH KKKKKK esse maluco só toca pro lado, foden é reserva no City e na Inglaterra vsfd tu quer comparar um cara q é reserva cm saka q tava deitando na premier, saka ganhou 2 vezes o prêmio de melhor do mês da premier league nessa temporada enquanto esse fdp tava no banco

@hateskatesdpc @smokinjoe8487 @FBAwayDays You're probably the worse club to ever play in Premier league. Literally nothing about Southampton is good. Terrible stadium, DREADFUL fans and a no personality club.
@TNTSportsBR kkkkk Neymar com 50 anos seria eleito melhor jogador na Premier League.
@10EHag @BludHag @rxlfpacked @ireayoing @UtdEIIis Correct, ronaldo also was north of 500k. De bruyne deal is best premier league deal ever. First deal where 50m a season was possible, haaland was expected to bank 40m this season, less than de bruyne
@p6trgh2cts All of the premier League is about money now and all football really. It's ridiculous that oil- rich states can buy a football club..

@JG_WBA @allnewswba We just couldn’t attract a player like that now man. Soon as a team with some ambition or a slight bit of money comes along we’re out of the picture. Our realistic transfer targets will only be able to consist of championship/good league 1 or old premier league players
@Sholly_Jayyy @PoojaMedia And he won you in the premier league
@Logxnlufc NOT £40m, Forest paid an initial fee of £25m, the rest of the eventual £42.5m fee is made up of add-ons if they are all met. The first add-on is likely to have been triggered with Forest staying in the Premier League.

@Onoriode_Odj_ @emmyraldvisuals Why should I drop Mount stat in the UCL and drop Saka stat in the Premier league? 

Mount is the only Chelsea player ever to record a goal or assist in every stage of the UCL to win it that season but you are too dvll to know.

@exarkunaguero @kuzmitchov @JordanTyrell12 @MrProWestie @WelBeast The premier league ain't carrying out a police investigation. For example, any company can carry out an investigation and potentially fire one of their employees if they commit corruption within the company.

premier league manager of the season should be gary oneil, bournemouth should have been relegated in february.
@ThomasUTD_ One good reason to keep a guy who has missed 70 games and scored 10 premier league goals in 3 seasons…Let’s not judge him on stats though right? https://t.co/Xw2Je9H4vv
@fin34436631 Even the hashtag 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Dominic Calvert-Lewin nie zagra w meczu o utrzymanie w Premier League z Bournemouth. Anglik wypada na 5 tygodni. Olbrzymi problem dla Evertonu. Neal Maupay w ofensywie nie daje niemal nic, Ellis Simms nie ma doświadczenia w tak ważnych spotkaniach.
@ADAMNUTS I preferred Saturday night 😍
@Hazardaddy @Iewdawg He had 10 premier league appearances, 5 starts, 1 assist. Had 9 Europa league appearances 7 starts, 4 goals. He didn’t feature for Chelsea until after January under Sarri. I’m positive
@amar_siiingh @LCFC Still feeling as positive? X
This Saturday I'm on FA Player commentary for WSL final day (@ManCityWomen v @EvertonWomen) then going straight from that into being live on air with a special Saturday Sports Show while my beloved Coventry City go for the Premier League.

Maldini: "El poder económico que tienen los equipos de la Premier League es superior al nuestro, pero nosotros tenemos tradición e ideas".
@M_rashid_MD @Dobbo0107 Not really, he knows Premier League, he plays on a possession based team that play out from the back with De Zerbi, it's like Trossard but better.
Maldini: "Desde entonces, sufrió la fatiga y se ubicó detrás de clubes como el PSG, Real Madrid y Manchester United. Ahora, en términos de mercado, luchamos y perdemos desde el punto de vista económico: equipos de la Premier League que están en el puesto 18 tienen más dinero".
If soft boy found the Premier League too physical, wait until we play Millwall away and Shaun Hutchinson flattens him.

It will be interesting to see how the negotiations between United and PSG develop. If they are able to agree a deal, it would be a major coup for United, and it would give them a real chance of challenging for the Premier League title next season.

From report in @TheAthleticFC on future of Leeds United, in light of likely Premier League relegation:

▫️ Club "very keen" to keep Tyler Adams, whether in EPL or Championship

▫️ Weston McKennie "certain to leave" at end of season, even if Leeds stay up

▫️ No Aaronson update https://t.co/xpL44nB9yX
@JackFatty_ @TheOfficialFNG I don't think it's fair to criticise bazunu tbh, the defense has to play a part in defending the goal which the saints have not been good at this season. Making the step up from being the best goalie in league 1 to a struggling premier league side was never going to be easy...

🚨 Tim Sherwood Says William Saliba is Key to Arsenal's Premier League Title Hopes Next Season

🗣️ "Saliba there wasn’t a replacement for him, the solidity that they needed, he’s only a young man, he was on loan last season and he’ll only get better. If they keep him fit next season they’ll win the league or they’ll have a chance of winning the league," says Tim Sherwood
 on Premier League Productions.

🗣️ Sherwood emphasizes Saliba's importance to Arsenal, suggesting that his fitness could be the determining factor in Arsenal's title contention next season.

🗣️ Saliba's breakout season at Arsenal has proven his value to the team, and his absence due to injury has highlighted the impact he has on the squad. #Arsenal #PremierLeague
@jdevans141 @HemmenKees No he’s better than that. He at least would have some utility on a mid tier premier league team. Would be great for anyone not looking to play a possession based game. Just doesn’t work for us.

@footballdaily @MiguelDelaney But what can anyone do, you have to respect due process when applying the law in any civilised society. The Premier league fucked up announcing them as they did, it should have been kept underwraps until an official finding was imminent. It's a private hearing, easily done.
@JackPLoftus He’s losing half the squad and doesn’t like the other half. I don’t know a single credible premier league manager who would be happy to not be backed, especially knowing you’re losing half your squad. Surely wolves knew this. They need to put a stop to the

The fourth edition of the Lanka Premier League (LPL) will begin on July 30, with the tournament to be staged in Colombo and Kandy. 

Among the key changes for this season is that franchises will pick players through a player auction, as opposed to the player draft used for the last three seasons. 

Franchises will have upto 1 million US dollars as a salary cap to build their franchises at the player auction. 

South African David Miller, Pakistan national captain Babar Azam are among the overseas players who have been signed for this year's tournament.
The premier league actually isn’t ready for this duo.

Adjustment on the kickoff time of Match-Day 30

As we draw closer to the season’s end scheduled for Saturday 27th May 2023, with one match left and yet the difference between the Top three clubs is 2 points; the UPL Secretariat has adjusted the kickoff time for Match-Day 30 from 4:00pm to 3:00pm.

This is done to enable us hold a successful crowning event at any of the venues for the Club that emerges Champions for the 2022/23 StarTimes Uganda Premier League.

Luton Town está en la final de Playoff de ascenso a la Premier League.

A un equipo así no le permitirían jugar en la LIGA MX los dueños antideportivos y avariciosos que manejan a Mikel Arriola.

Su estadio, el Kenilworth Road, tiene aforo de 10,356 aficionados, que sería impensado en las certificaciones de ascenso en México.

Si ascienden solo tendrían que hacer unas adecuaciones para cumplir requisitos de transmisiones de televisión de la EPL.

@shambhav15 Hindutva is the reason why Arsenal bottled the Premier league to Man City.

@MrScrewerNFFC They will fight in December buddy, all this is just crap to build up the fight make no qualms about that.. least we agree on one thing pal premier league reds!!!
@ryjavfc @Calder197 @SullivanNigel @talkSPORT But none of them have challenged for the league in around 40 years. The period when football and the premier league became big and global, only Newcastle have been relevant.
@MarioALNG @itsjustfruity @USMNT_Thoughts The production costs are probably higher this year since they had to bring in IMG to get the season started on time. 
 
Your last bit is just fantasy.  USL could quickly replace MLS, but I'm sure an American Premier League would form quickly.

Se cumplen 2 años del último partido del Kun Agüero con Manchester City.

Aquel día, marcó un doblete y se convirtió en el máximo goleador en un mismo club de la Premier League, dejando atrás a Rooney. El Kun marcó 184 goles en 275 partidos, mientras que Wayne hizo 183 en 393 encuentros.

Ganó un total de 5 Premier Leagues, 6 Copas de la Liga, 3 Community Shields y 1 FA Cup. 15 títulos en 10 años.

Todavía no caemos en el tremendo ídolo que es el Kun para el City 🇦🇷🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿

@BeardSplitter_ @balogun Premier League goals are cut different than France goals. France is a very open, explosive attacking league. The EPL is faster, bigger, more technical, and more physical. So far Balogun's EPL goal tally is zero. He's the most decorated US player in Ligue 1 history.
In 1998, England could only send the Premier League champion directly to the Group Stage and a runner-up to the 2nd qualifying round. From 1999 to 2001, three PL clubs could go. From 2002 and on, that number was four. I'll give you ONE GUESS, who the fourth PL club was that year.

I agree. In fact, they are the only club that can challenge Manchester City in the Premier league going forward as long as Pep stays put. Because they have the right manager. They have the riches and they have the supporters culture few other clubs have.

So Pep is continuing to treat the Premier League like a dog on a leash, and all that is left is the FA Cup and Champions League. Sorry, after he figured out the importance of defending; neither United or Inter are stopping him from the Treble dub.

@BingbongbangXD @IliasY_Nada_Mas @sysabef He's only 40million. It's a lot for Feyenoord, sure, but not much for a Premier league club

They did play against Arsenal too and only lost 1-0 at home and 3-0 away. Their coach is always on the shortlist when the lower half premier league teams sack their coaches too.
@ihateUEFA @markgoldbridge If you read what I say, I agree with you. However with things like Premier League years out there, we have access to much more than ‘one clip’. In some circumstances, we have highlights from every game over a season.

At the mere age of 22 amepita the best in the game, kina Drogba, Ronaldo, Kompany, na Lampard! Ni youngin yupi mwingine ako na potential ya ku make such an achievement? #NiSeasonYako https://t.co/Aj1geAv5lj
Everton definitely the most cinch coded club in the Premier League for my money. Never win anything, silly owners and fans always at their wits end but good at having a laugh at their own expense just my #twocents
@M_Bobz @Meczykipl @M_Gutka Ty nawet czytać nie umiesz "Kevin De Bruyne to najlepszy pomocnik w historii Premier League"🤦
@WelBeast This week so that u be declared premier league champions🤣🤣🤣🤣
@UtdXclusive @TuttoMercatoWeb No thanks. We need him to be sold. Why wait for a year to sell him for €5m? We could sell him to a premier league team for £10mil easily
The type of football displayed in Uganda Premier League this season is so alarming! nothing to talk about you can even hardly point out a player that has stood out. Then the care in stadiums like Kcca grounds does not help literally nothing would warranty a fan to come rushing😡
Bukayo Saka is here to stay. God’s Son has been a true blessing for Arsenal since making his Premier League debut four seasons ago. Now at the age of 21, The Starboy has grown into The Man and committed his future to the cause. The next chapter awaits. https://t.co/zb7e2aLTrV

La renovación de Saka es clave para el presente y el futuro del club, siendo una cara de la intención del proyecto. Si la intención es pelear la Premier League por mucho tiempo, la continuidad de Saka es un paso importante.
@cwiakala Kounde może odejść za bardzo sensowne pieniądze, 70-80 milinów z Premier League wydaje się realne. Pomimo sympatii do Kounde ja bym się nie zastanwiał, wizja trenera jest ważniejsza niż preferencje zawodnika.

Before that, they were even knocked out of all the available competitions just to concentrate on winning the premier league 🤣

@btsportfootball Our final premier league game for a while ……. 👀
To the clots saying whoever wins from Luton v Coventry in the play-off final will get a record low number of points next season: it’s easier to stay up in the Premier League than getting promoted from the Championship. The bottom five in the EPL is always a mess.

É bizarro pensar que Saka e Rafael Leão estão renovando contrato ao mesmo tempo e o Saka vai receber 3 vezes mais do que o Leão.

A diferença financeira da Premier League pro resto é enorme.

Torcida do Milan tem que ser muito grata ao Leão por renovar por um salário que até time que briga por rebaixamento na Premier League pagaria.

We’re getting there. 

So Premier league is all about 2nd balls, control the air and you got the game. Not aligned with Champions league.

Spain - control the ball and you got the game - Aligned with CL 

A key factor towards this is the interesting part here.

An odd take to be honest. Football in Botswana doesn't bring any revenue or ROI, for a club as new as VTM with its ambitions they had to find ways of attracting fans to their games and on field trying to get promotion to the premier league how valuable was those guys' experience?

I’d be incredibly surprised if your two best players left, despite promotion to the premier league, when they’re unproven at that level. Also, you’ll have 180 million more than you currently do, and need to rebuild anyway as you’ve said. Weird take

From a content creator’s angle, I can only wonder the number of works the Arsenal media team would have put into creating content with the hope that Arsenal win the premier league. 

All content created, videos kept are now a waste. Wow!

@Seneziz In Premier League you need to run a lot more than in Champions, perfectly explained by you.
In Champions you win by not giving away the ball, and in Prem you win by taking the ball back as quickly as possible.
@Islika1 @AnfieldWatch @LFC ... that doesn't mean we can't beat them in a game. It means we can't beat them overall on points in 38 games. They can put their B team and win a Premier league game against a mid table team. We can't.
@MiguelDelaney Another weird bit: the Premier League socials celebrating City's title win (over 30 posts on the Premier League Instagram since Saturday), when the organisation represented by that account has lodged 115 charges against that club. Seems strange. https://t.co/kTxwLeMIzN
@ESPNFC Of course Pep Guardiola for winning the premier league for the the third time in a row, that's incredible since no other manager in the premier league has done that except Sir Alex Furguson with Manchester united.

There will be a Premier League vacancy within months of the new season for him
56 - Bukayo Saka has been directly involved in 56 goals in the Premier League (30G, 26A), which is the exact same figure as Cesc Fàbregas when the Spaniard was the same age (21 years 260 days). Only four players have been involved in more goals as of Saka's current age. Gooner. https://t.co/Hy5Usqxwe7

@13411Fahad @eire_gooner The reason age is important is because as your career goes on every new contract should be (all going well) bigger than the last. So when Grealish was 23/24 he was on 60k at Villa. Then Villa put him on 120k when they got back to the premier league and put in the release clause

@CharDuncker Really interesting read that, thanks. I hope the situation regarding the head physio is resolved sooner rather than later. Injuries nearly caused this season to end very differently - we can't afford that to happen again.

@laurafreiganggg @baulbvb @iMiaSanMia @BILD Those friendships are in many times older than some teams in the Premier League or Ligue 1. Many of them are based on events that happened or crisis that one club helped the other to get through. Rivalries and derbies in most leagues are washed down and commercialised anyways.

@FPLTips_Zone Kane &amp; Firmino 💪🏻💪🏻
@linnet1976 In my opinion, whether you're a premier league side or non-league, get the players in early and get all the announcements out quick time, too, that gives the fans a buzz and will increase sales for season tickets. You look at Chester, sold 1,500 early bird season tickets

For a club who feared relegation last season and since 2007 had an owner who ran them woefully. To finish in the top 4 of the Premier League, beating the likes of Liverpool, Chelsea and Spurs to that spot, is a massive achievement and one which should not be understated.

Some people(rival fans) are outraged at Saka getting 300k a week. One of the best players in the Premier League will earn 300k a week, absolutely shocking😮. Agenda really does trump logic sometimes.
@JackB2498J @ScottNUFC1892 @ChampionsLeague (C) is so infused with the premier league that every single team in someway or another that the selective outrage is crazy. 

Be consistent if you’re going to call Newcastle out. 

Eddie Howe and those players have done an amazing job, if you can’t see that. You’re bitter.

@vinijr A Espanha é racista. La Liga é racista e não vai punir ninguem.

@HaarrryK @FRRichard70 Naja probleem met veel van die spelers is dat je die ook kan vinden bij de nummer 13 en 15 in de premier league. Vandaar dat ik middelmaat bedoelde, probleem bij Tottenham blijf ik toch wel vinden is dat ze zichzelf identificeren als top club terwijl ze dat eigenlijk niet zijn.

@LarryClaret1 @SkySportsPL @Carra23 @GNev2 Bought the title has nothing to do with net spend? If you just take total spend in those 1st 3 premier league seasons before their title win. Arsenal, Liverpool, Leeds, Spurs and United all spent as comparable amount.
Who’s winning tomorrow?

@LiveSwfc 39 premier league appearances is incredible
@secondtierpod @NiiLampteyShow How about give credit to players such as Wilson, Sheaf, Allen, Bidwell etc who have stepped up massively this season along with the likes of Viktor and Hamer. We need to rebuild but I don’t know about us being the “worst premier league team ever “ if we do get promoted.

@RyanSoccerAA Simms can’t be judged on anything as he hasn’t had a run of games at premier league level. 
Granted Dyche has seen him in training over recent months and clearly sees him behind Maupay currently but none of us can judge him in my opinion.
always does his all to try and secure the win for the boss. Some honourable mentions for the Premier League are: Mohamed Salah, Bukayo Saka, Kevin De Bruyne, Marcus Rashford, and Gabriel Martinelli respectively.
I don’t think anyone can argue the fact that Erling Haaland has been the Premier League’s best player this season, at only 23, the Norwegian international has broken expectations that were already outlandish, with 52 goals in all competitions at the time of me writing this.
He doesn’t have the technical ability of a premier league footballer, but neither do most of our players.

Be pre season for him

Algunos son tan ilusos de creer que la culpa es de los DTs. Pero lastimosamente ocupamos una limpia profunda, incluso de los jugadores nuevos que nunca debieron ser comprados https://t.co/YMea0fnwjd
@EthanFromOnline @talkingmonkeys0 Completely disagree, he played in the Premier league once and he looked miles better than Messlier. He hasn't been given a chance
PEP 💬 Los dos equipos a los que tenemos que enfrentar en la Premier League, Brighton y Brentford, merecen nuestra atención... Tenemos que centrarnos completamente en estos dos partidos. Son dos equipos realmente buenos.
@tierniestaa Mate, teh post is about their premier league career so Mahrez playing for Leicester is relevant, Salah playing for Roma ain't XDD read again carefully and come back
@pascoraldo7 @ManUtdMania_ Buying players in their 30's doesn't mean we are not ambitious or hungry for success but with the way the premier league is going, we desperately need a traditional no 9 that can score 20+ goals..so if kane scores that for 3-4 season for United it is a no brainer mate!
🏆🏆LEAGUE &amp; CUP DOUBLE!

Plus I will take "the worst team in the Premier league" with 180 mil in the bank, and given 6 years ago we was preparing for a campaign in league 2, I would say we deserve it and have defied all odds in doing so, and continue to do so now.

When was the last time a manager that has managed both in the Bundesliga and the Premier league was seriously considering taking the USMNT job? Oh right never. If Jesse Marsch had some exotic foreign-sounding name some of y’all who are critics would be drooling all over him. The self loathing of some people who obsess  about the US MNT and base their entire soccer world view around a team that plays a dozen times a year or whatever is unbelievable. And it’s a national team not a club team. The US men’s job isn’t even equivalent to most first division jobs in major European leagues (or even some MLS jobs imo) so the possibility of getting someone who has managed in  those two leagues who is American who has a system is incredible. It’s the jackpot. I really hate even thinking about the USMNT but I’m a Jesse Marsch guy, so that’s why I waded into this conversation. I wanted him in 2018 when he didn’t yet have this European experience so he should be a lock now imo. I’m sure some of y’all will have at it now.

@Justus1z @jacksonbella120 @EveritinGud @asifkhoja @Joshua_Ubeku He broke the Premier League goal scoring record, is fastest to 30 UCL goals, fastest to 6 Prem hattricks, most Prem goals before January, most goals in all competitions as a Prem player, youngest to 30 UCL goals, 2 POTM awards and that's not even all of what he did

@LiamSpurs1 I understand some people’s concern as he’s untested in premier league however there’s lots to be positive about with Slot and I really don’t care what other fans think so not convincing myself because of bantering from opposing fans.
If you don’t need to be good to win the champions league then man city should have won it numerous of time. 

You disregard our progress and all the trophies we have won in the pass 5 season because we’ve not won the premier league,you are quite a comedian
Stan Kroenke KSE is 4 games away from winning a Super Bowl, a Stanley Cup, and NBA Championship all within 18 months. Arsenal also nearly won the premier league this season. Is he the most successful owner to win across multiple sports?

🚨 BREAKING:

Ex Germany captain and legend Lothar Matthäus has invested €2 million to make full purchase of Ghana Premier League side Accra Lions. 

Lothar Matthäus told Bild Sport:

"Of course, it's a business model. Ghana has always had a huge potential of talent, you can see that in the national team.”

"We want to bring young players to Europe. On a serious path and already well trained. That's why investments are also made here in the training area."

@Neycromancer @FabrizioRomano @TheSun He's used to not needing to defend and track back. When things are not going to plan he's useless. Would have his moments but that's all imo in the premier league.

@goooner79 @GoonerRichB Since he joined the team has improved.

btw our lowest season total in premier league history came from those same unmotivated players.

Being out of the CL came from those players.
@JJar799 @talkSPORT Newcastle 6 top 4 finishes, Villa 3 top 4 finishes, Everton 1 top 4 finish, and Leeds 3 top 4 finishes since the era of the premier league. Think Villa are shit, always will be, so they finish bottom. Leeds, self explanatory, and Everton, well not much really to say on them. 😊

@Diiiillon @LFCRedRobbo @GarBreeninhoLfc @GNev2 @Carra23 @FA_PGMOL Yes but from different perspectives. My point is: it's empty to say that explicitly [insert moment] call by the ref is bad. The refs in the Premier League just suck. Period. I am still wondering why you felt the need to target LFC, especially given the op didn't even mention LFC.

This season, we got to witness 3 types of Arsenal fans

1. THE PASSIVE FANS
The ones we didn't know were actually Arsenal fans before the start of the season.

They became active all season, only to go back into hiding a couple of weeks ago 😅

They don't make a lot of noise these ones 

2. THE MAN CITY-ARSENAL-MAN CITY FANS

This type used to be Arsenal fans during the Arsene Wenger era but had gone to Man City in search of the glory that comes with silverware

Only to come back to Arsenal this season, rejuvenated and making most of the noise. You could tell they are truly Arsenal fans in a Man City mask 😅

By now, they're probably back to supporting Man City 😅

They are not loyal these ones 

3. DIE-HARD FANS

These ones had a sense of achievement for most parts of the season. Finally, their patience was beginning to pay off

They would tell you how long they waited for this moment

Surprisingly, they're the same fans who are sympathising and appreciating what Mikel Arteta has achieved so far. They can take anything as long as it is one step forward

Very loyal and faithful these ones

You don't need to award him. For me, he already is.

It's not only the tactics. It's the fact that each and every player has improved under Howe.

Longstaff, Joelinton, Schar, Almiron, Murphy etc have gone from playing like the don't belong in the Premier League to leading the Club to a top 4 finish. 

And all this, while building a team that has no egos, a real brotherhood. Something we couldn't claim even when Rafa or Sir Bobby was here.

@PassLikeThiago Most Asisst in premier league season next Season is not safe 😮
@htomufc Hopefully he stays another year with Feyenoord and goes on a ucl run with them. He shouldn’t rush to the premier league yet, would be interesting to see how far he could take them in the ucl too.
Ahead of the Premier league finals night...... I feel this is one of the toughest finals lineups we have seen in awhile. All players playing well and hitting form at the right time.

@Joeytaylor123 Not sure what's more offensive here? The deflating negativity when it's a chance to get everybody more hyped (yes if we win we are up against it in the Premier League but worry about that after the game) or the abysmal timing?
@SiriusXMFC @NeilSpyBarnett Serie A's best team over the past decade gets docked points for poor finances. You may not like italian football but at least our league has the cajones to put their top clubs to the sword unlike other leagues..... premier league.
@DangerDaveDixon @GeordieChris_F @TransferChecker Not sure if you're aware but there was a takeover that went through and we play in the Premier league. Was quite obvious we'd be challenging for Europe this season
@UtdPlug @lequipe It will be great to see Neymar in premier league.
He can still cook.
Disappointing not to keep Michut he has real potential. But I think he will have been contacted by a Premier League club and wouldn’t have wanted to stay. Ekwah is probably going to be a more effective option for us in the championship anyway due to the physicality #safc

Vinicius should just come to the Premier league man. As long as he doesn't do that kneeling thing, he won't be racially abused. 
Racially Profiled maybe on non match day's but it's gotta be better than where he is x
@iam_wilsons @FabrizioRomano @footballdaily Selling Wood meant he cost us £10m. His goals helped keep us in the Premier League so turned out fine. Eddie seems delighted to get Gordon. Technically he’s a great player and pace to burn. Eddie will bring him to the next level then that £40m will be justified. Like Joelinton
@StaceySellars4 @SkyBet @LutonTown Your right, but the premier league can be fussy buggers at times. Look forward to going back there, just Coventry to beat.

@r_insights23 @LoftforWords Agree on zero alignment. Brighton were in the Champ 10 years ago getting Premier League ready. We were in the Premier League 10 years ago about to be League One ready. It's important to look at clubs like Brighton &amp; Brentford to show what alignment can do.

There are also some fantastic goalkeepers to play in the league, so it makes the argument for Alisson to be the best quite difficult.

Se consideramos a ordem cronológica, o Arsenal passou 31 rodadas na liderança da Premier League 2022-23.
🔝 Temporadas em que o Arsenal ficou mais na liderança da Premier League (contando jogos atrasados em suas rodadas):

2002-03 - 28R
2022-23 - 27R
2003-04 - 27R 🏆
2013-14 - 18R
2007-08 - 18R

Quando liderou a liga por mais de 11 rodadas, só saiu campeão em uma vez (invicto).
